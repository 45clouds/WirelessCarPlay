# WirelessCarPlay
Wireless CarPlay for CarPlay enabled cars

# Binaries

This is Apple Carplay SDK compiled for RPi3 (Debian 10 Buster armv7l).
libdns_sd is coming from the latest mDNSResolver published by Apple.

# Requirements

There are a lot of dependencies for CarPlay SDK. It is not easy to compile
it on RPi3. I will try to describe whole process as soon as I will finish
with all binaries.
