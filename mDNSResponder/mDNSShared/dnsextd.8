.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a daemon invoked at boot time, running alongside BIND 9,
to implement two EDNS0 extensions to the standard DNS protocol.
.Pp
.Nm
allows clients to perform DNS Updates with an attached lease lifetime,
so that if the client crashes or is disconnected from the network, its
address records will be automatically deleted after the lease expires.
.Pp
.Nm
allows clients to perform long-lived queries. Instead of rapidly polling
the server to discover when information changes, long-lived queries
enable a client to indicate its interest in some set of data, and then
be notified asynchronously by the server whenever any of that data changes.
.Pp
.Nm
has no user-specifiable command-line argument, and users should not run
.Nm
manually.
