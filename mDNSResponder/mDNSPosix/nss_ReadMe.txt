# Readme for libnss_mdns

# Introduction

This code implements a module for the Name Service Switch to perform
hostname lookups using the Darwin mDNSResponder / mdnsd.  This code has
been tested on Debian and Redhat Linux.  It may work on other platforms. 
It *will not* work on Darwin or Mac OS X - the necessary functionality is
already built into the operation system.


# Building and Installing:

See "ReadMe.txt" for instructions on building and installing.

When you run "make install" as described in that file:
o libnss_mdns-0.2.so and libnss_mdns.so.2 are installed in /lib,
o manual pages libnss_mdns(8) and nss_mdns.conf(5) are installed,
o nss_mdns.conf is installed in /etc, and
o /etc/nsswitch.conf is modified to add "mdns" on the "hosts:" line

This will cause dns lookups to be passed via mdnsd before trying the dns.


# Testing

For most purposes, 'ping myhostname.local' will tell you if mdns is
working.  If MDNS_VERBOSE was set in nss_mdns.c during compilation then
lots of chatty debug messages will be dumped to LOG_DEBUG in syslog. 
Otherwise, nss_mdns will only log if something isn't behaving quite right.


# Implementation details

libnss_mdns provides alternative back-end implementations of the libc
functions gethostbyname, gethostbyname2 and gethostbyaddr, using the Name
Service Switch mechanism.  More information on writing nsswitch modules
can be found via 'info libc "Name Service Switch"', if installed.
